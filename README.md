# üîç Automated Vulnerability Scanner

This Python script automates several vulnerability and enumeration scans for a given target using popular tools like **Nmap**, **Nikto**, **SSLScan**, **BloodHound**, **BEEF**, and **Uniscan**.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- **Nmap** - Port scanning and service/version detection
- **Nikto** - Web server scanner
- **SSLScan** - SSL/TLS configuration testing
- **BloodHound** - AD enumeration (requires credentials)
- **BEEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)** - Client-side web exploits
- **Uniscan** - Web vulnerability scanner

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Tools like BEEF and BloodHound must be installed and configured properly in your environment.

- Tools installed and available in PATH:
  - `nmap`
  - `nikto`
  - `sslscan`
  - `uniscan`
  - `bloodhound` (or relevant command interface)
  - `BEEF-XSS` (or your BEEF command path)

## üì• Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vuln-scanner.git
